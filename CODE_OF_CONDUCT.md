# Code of Conduct

The Statbus community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We value contributions based on merit and encourage respectful collaboration on GitHub.

This code applies to all Statbus spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and related events. All interactions must comply with GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), which prohibit harassment, abuse, or threats.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful and constructive in feedback.
- Focus on the code and ideas, not individuals.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Sexualized language or advances.
- Publishing private information without permission.
- Other conduct inappropriate for a professional setting.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers will address violations fairly, including warnings, edits, or bans as needed. We defer to GitHub for severe issues.

## Reporting Harassment
Report violations to project maintainers at Erik.Soberg@ssb.no. For platform abuse, you may also report issues to GitHub Support at [support.github.com](https://support.github.com/contact). For urgent threats, contact local authorities.

This Code is adapted from the Open Source Guides and aligns with GitHub's community standards. Questions? Open an issue.
