-- Down Migration 20260429224008: slot keyed statistical history aggregation
--
-- Restores the rc.42 procedure bodies verbatim (range-keyed aggregation).
-- Includes a symmetric one-time DELETE of all per-partition rows so the
-- next analytics drain rebuilds at the rc.42 geometry — required because
-- per-slot rows written under the slot-keyed model would not be matched
-- by rc.42's exact-equality DELETE in derive_statistical_history_period.
