mode: Mainline # Main versioning mode; each commit on master increments the version

# Branch configuration: customizes how different types of branches are handled
branches:
  master:
    regex: master # Identifies the master branch
    tag: '' # No additional tag for master branch versions

  # Feature branches (e.g., feature/new-cool-feature or feat/new-cool-feature)
  feature:
    regex: '^features?[/-]' # Regex to match feature branch names
    mode: ContinuousDelivery # Continuous Delivery mode for feature branches
    tag: 'feature' # Tag version numbers with 'feature'
    increment: Minor # Minor version increments for new features
    source-branches: ['master', 'develop']  # Specify the branches that can be sources for feature branches

  # Fix branches (e.g., fix/bug-fix)
  fix:
    regex: '^fix(es)?[/-]' # Regex to match fix branch names
    mode: ContinuousDelivery # Continuous Delivery mode for fix branches
    tag: 'fix' # Tag version numbers with 'fix'
