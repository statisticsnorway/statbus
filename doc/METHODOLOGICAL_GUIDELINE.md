# Statistical Business Register (SBR) Methodological Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

The Statistical Business Register (SBR) serves as the backbone for economic statistics,
providing a comprehensive and up-to-date system for business statistics and business surveys.
This document outlines the methodological principles and practices for maintaining the SBR.

## 2. Core Statistical Units

### 2.1 Establishments (ES) - Physical Domain
- Basic statistical unit representing physical economic activity
- Located in a single physical place
- Carries out a single productive activity
- Observable physical presence and operations
- Foundation for both formal and informal economy tracking
- Represents the actual location where economic activity occurs

### 2.2 Legal Units (LU) - Legal/Official Domain
- Legal/administrative entity in official records
- Bears legal rights and obligations
- Can own assets, incur liabilities, and engage in contracts
- Registered with government authorities
- Part of formal economy structure
- Defined by legal and administrative frameworks

### 2.3 Enterprises (EN) - Statistical Domain
- Statistical construct created by the Statistical Agency
- Represents autonomous economic decision-making units
- Statistical Agency determines grouping based on:
  * Economic autonomy assessment
  * Market behavior analysis
  * Operational independence
- Two formation paths at agency's discretion:
  * Formal: Grouping of Legal Units into an Enterprise (LU => EN)
  * Informal: Grouping of Establishments into an Enterprise (ES => EN)

### 2.4 Power Groups TBC (enterprisegroups)
- Collection of Legal Units based on ownership relationships
- Represents control and ownership structures
- Maps ownership networks and power relationships
- May operate across national boundaries

### 2.5 Economic Structure Relationships
#### Formal Economy Path
- Establishments (ES) => Legal Units (LU) => Enterprises (EN)
- Legal Units may belong to Power Groups based on ownership
- Follows full legal and administrative structure
- Complete registration and documentation
- Usually obtained by tax authorities.

#### Informal Economy Path
- Establishments (ES) => Enterprises (EN)
- Direct linkage without legal unit intermediary
- Captures economic activity outside formal structures
- Not typically associated with Power Groups
- Usually collected through a business censuses.

## 3. Key Variables

### 3.1 Identification
- Unique identifiers for each statistical unit
- Links between different statistical units
- Historical tracking of changes
- Statbus comes pre loaded with tax_ident and stat_ident.
- The tax_ident is from official sources.
- The stat_ident can be generated by the statistical system, if required.

### 3.2 Stratification
Stratification is always connected to something observable in the real world,
i.e. not invented. Therefore classifications and measurements are connected to
either an Establishment or a Legal Unit.
The system as a whole either uses NACE (EU) or ISIC (UN) for economic activity classification.

### 3.2.1 Establishment Stratification
- Economic activity classification
- Size measures (employment, turnover)
- Geographic location
- Institutional sector
- Legal form

### 3.2.2 Legal Unit Stratification
- Economic activity classification
- Size measures (employment, turnover)
- Geographic location
- Institutional sector
- Legal form

### 3.3 Demographic Events
- Births and deaths of units
- Mergers and splits
- Changes in control
- Restructuring events
