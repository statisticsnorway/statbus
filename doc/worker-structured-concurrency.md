# Worker Structured Concurrency

This document describes the structured concurrency model used in the STATBUS worker system, inspired by [Trio's nurseries](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#tasks-let-you-do-multiple-things-at-once) and similar patterns.

## Overview

Structured concurrency provides a disciplined approach to concurrent task execution with clear boundaries and automatic synchronization. The key principles are:

1. **Fan-out**: A parent task spawns multiple child tasks
2. **Sync point**: The parent waits until ALL children complete
3. **Continue**: Only after sync point does the parent complete

This contrasts with unstructured concurrency where tasks are "fire and forget" with no automatic coordination.

## Task States

```
pending → processing → completed
                    ↘ failed
                    ↘ waiting (parent with children)
processing → interrupted (engine crash, transaction rolled back)
interrupted → processing (serial fiber retries, picked BEFORE pending)
```

- **pending**: Task ready to be picked up
- **processing**: Task currently executing
- **interrupted**: Engine crashed while processing; transaction was rolled back, safe to retry. Not subject to dedup constraints (multiple interrupted tasks can coexist with a pending task of the same command)
- **waiting**: Parent task has spawned children and awaits their completion
- **completed**: Task finished successfully
- **failed**: Task encountered an error

## Parent-Child Relationships

### Spawning Children

A handler procedure spawns child tasks using `worker.spawn()`:

```sql
-- Inside derive_statistical_unit handler
CALL worker.spawn(
    p_command => 'statistical_unit_refresh_batch',
    p_payload => jsonb_build_object('batch_seq', 1, 'enterprise_ids', ARRAY[1,2,3]),
    p_parent_id => p_task_id,  -- Links child to parent
    p_priority => 20
);
```

When a task spawns children:
1. Children are created with `parent_id` pointing to the parent task
2. After the handler returns, `process_tasks` checks if children exist
3. If children exist, parent state becomes `waiting` (not `completed`)

### Automatic Parent Completion

When a child task completes (or fails):
1. `complete_parent_if_ready()` is called automatically
2. It checks if all siblings are finished (completed or failed)
3. If all done:
   - If any child failed → parent fails
   - If all children completed → parent completes
4. Parent's `completed_at` timestamp is set

### Info Aggregation

Each handler reports what it did via `INOUT p_info jsonb`. When
`complete_parent_if_ready()` completes a parent, it merges all children's
info using SUM for numeric values. See [worker.md](worker.md#task-info-reporting)
for details and the Info Principle.

### Recursive Nesting

The system supports **recursive** parent-child relationships:
- Children can spawn grandchildren (arbitrary depth)
- Children can spawn siblings (same `parent_id`)
- Children can spawn uncle tasks (`parent_id IS NULL`)
- `depth` column tracks nesting level (0 = top-level, parent.depth + 1 for children)
- `child_mode` on the parent controls child execution: `'concurrent'` (parallel, default) or `'serial'` (one at a time)
- Depth-first parent selection ensures grandchildren complete before the fiber moves up

### Dynamic Work Spreading

Children can spawn more siblings at the same priority level, enabling dynamic batching:

```sql
-- Child task discovers more work needed, spawns sibling
CALL worker.spawn(
    p_command => 'statistical_unit_refresh_batch',
    p_payload => jsonb_build_object('batch_seq', 99, ...),
    p_parent_id => (SELECT parent_id FROM worker.tasks WHERE id = current_task_id),
    p_priority => 20  -- Same priority as siblings
);
```

This allows:
- Initial coarse batching that subdivides as needed
- Work discovery during processing (e.g., finding more affected entities)
- Load balancing by splitting large batches into smaller ones

The parent remains in `waiting` state until ALL children (including dynamically spawned ones) complete.

## How Fibers Cooperate

Each queue has **1 serial fiber** and **N concurrent fibers** (where N = concurrency - 1).
Two fiber types serve two purposes:

1. **Serial fiber** (1 per queue) — ensures **predictability**. Walks the serial path depth-first, one task at a time. Picks top-level tasks and serial children.
2. **Concurrent fibers** (N per queue) — ensures **speed**. A shared pool that processes concurrent work at any depth, up to the system resource limit.

For the original concept, see [Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go
statement considered harmful](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
by Nathaniel J. Smith.

### Serial Fiber (depth-first serial execution)

The serial fiber walks the serial path:
- Picks top-level pending tasks or serial children of waiting parents
- If the handler spawns children, the parent enters `waiting` state
- If a concurrent parent exists, the serial fiber **exits** → Crystal wakes concurrent fibers and **blocks**
- When all concurrent fibers signal done, the serial fiber resumes walking the serial path
- The serial fiber also picks serial children at any depth (not just top-level)

### Concurrent Fibers (parallel execution within scope)

Concurrent fibers sleep until the serial fiber wakes them:
- Each picks **one pending child** of the deepest concurrent parent (`LIMIT 1, SKIP LOCKED`)
- Multiple concurrent fibers process different children in parallel
- Each concurrent fiber is a full executor: if a child spawns serial sub-children, the fiber walks them inline
- When no more concurrent children remain, each signals the serial fiber and goes back to sleep

### Serial→Concurrent→Serial→Concurrent (arbitrary depth)

The tree can alternate between serial and concurrent at any depth:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Top-level tasks: strictly sequential (serial fiber)         │
│  ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐                              │
│  │Task A│→ │Task B│→ │Task C│  (one at a time)             │
│  └──────┘  └──────┘  └──────┘                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  When concurrent children exist: scoped concurrency          │
│                                                             │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐                      │
│  │ Parent Task (state: waiting)     │                      │
│  │ Serial fiber BLOCKED here        │                      │
│  │                                  │                      │
│  │  ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐  │                      │
│  │  │Child 1│ │Child 2│ │Child 3│  │  (parallel on        │
│  │  │Fiber 1│ │Fiber 2│ │Fiber 3│  │   concurrent fibers) │
│  │  └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘  │                      │
│  │              ↓                   │                      │
│  │     All children complete        │                      │
│  │              ↓                   │                      │
│  │     Parent → completed           │                      │
│  │     Serial fiber unblocked       │                      │
│  └──────────────────────────────────┘                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Phase Wrappers (Serial Child Trees)

The pipeline uses **phase wrappers** — intermediate tasks that group related
steps into a serial subtree. `collect_changes` pre-spawns the entire tree:

```
collect_changes (depth=0, serial)
├── derive_units_phase (depth=1, serial)
│   ├── derive_statistical_unit (depth=2, concurrent children at depth=3)
│   └── statistical_unit_flush_staging (depth=2, leaf)
└── derive_reports_phase (depth=1, serial)
    ├── derive_statistical_history (depth=2, concurrent children at depth=3)
    ├── statistical_history_reduce (depth=2, leaf)
    ├── derive_statistical_unit_facet (depth=2, concurrent children at depth=3)
    ├── statistical_unit_facet_reduce (depth=2, leaf)
    ├── derive_statistical_history_facet (depth=2, concurrent children at depth=3)
    └── statistical_history_facet_reduce (depth=2, leaf, terminal)
```

No mixed child_modes — each parent is purely serial or purely concurrent.
Max depth = 3. The tree is pre-spawned (no handler enqueues the next step),
so execution order is enforced structurally by serial `child_mode`.

## Example: How process_tasks handles 4 levels

Traced for the analytics queue (1 serial fiber + 3 concurrent fibers):

1. Serial fiber picks `collect_changes` (depth=0). Handler pre-spawns entire tree.
   Has-children check → `waiting`.
2. Serial fiber: `process_tasks(serial)` finds `collect_changes` is serial parent.
   Picks `derive_units_phase` (depth=1). Handler is a no-op, has pre-spawned
   children → `waiting`.
3. Serial fiber loops. Deepest serial parent is `derive_units_phase` (depth=1).
   Picks `derive_statistical_unit` (depth=2). Handler spawns concurrent batch
   grandchildren → `waiting`.
4. Serial fiber: `process_tasks(serial)` detects concurrent parent
   `derive_statistical_unit` (depth=2) → **exits**. Crystal wakes 3 concurrent fibers.
5. All 3 concurrent fibers process batch tasks (depth=3) in parallel via
   `SKIP LOCKED`.
6. All batches complete → `derive_statistical_unit` auto-completes.
   Concurrent fibers find no more concurrent parents → signal done.
   Serial fiber **unblocks**.
7. Serial fiber resumes. `derive_units_phase` (depth=1, serial) is deepest
   serial parent. Picks `statistical_unit_flush_staging` (depth=2, leaf).
8. `statistical_unit_flush_staging` completes → `derive_units_phase`
   auto-completes → `collect_changes` still has `derive_reports_phase` pending.
9. Serial fiber picks `derive_reports_phase`. Handler runs
   `adjust_analytics_partition_count()`, has pre-spawned children → `waiting`.
   Continues walking serial children, with concurrent fibers woken for
   concurrent grandchildren where applicable.
10. Eventually all work done. Serial fiber finds no more tasks.
    Waits for next notification.

## Why Skip ANALYZE in Batches?

`ANALYZE` acquires `ShareUpdateExclusiveLock` which conflicts with itself. If each batch task runs ANALYZE:

```
Fiber 1: ANALYZE establishment ← holds lock
Fiber 2: ANALYZE establishment ← blocked!
Fiber 3: ANALYZE establishment ← blocked!
Fiber 4: ANALYZE establishment ← blocked!
```

All concurrency is lost. Instead:
- Batch tasks skip ANALYZE (only do DELETE/INSERT)
- ANALYZE runs separately (not inside batch children)
- True parallel execution achieved

## Error Handling and Cascade-Fail

- If any child fails, parent eventually fails (after all children finish)
- `has_failed_siblings()` can be checked by children
- Failed state propagates upward but doesn't interrupt sibling execution
- **Cascade-fail**: When a task fails and has pre-spawned descendants still
  in `pending` or `waiting` state, `cascade_fail_descendants()` recursively
  marks them all as `failed` to prevent orphaned tasks

## Testing

```sql
-- Test structured concurrency in pg_regress
BEGIN;

-- Create parent task
INSERT INTO worker.tasks (command, payload)
VALUES ('derive_statistical_unit', '{}');

-- Process to create children
CALL worker.process_tasks(p_queue => 'analytics');

-- Verify parent is waiting
SELECT state FROM worker.tasks WHERE command = 'derive_statistical_unit';
-- Returns: waiting

-- Process children
CALL worker.process_tasks(p_queue => 'analytics');

-- Verify parent completed
SELECT state FROM worker.tasks WHERE command = 'derive_statistical_unit';
-- Returns: completed

ROLLBACK;
```
