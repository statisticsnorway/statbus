              A <strong>Legal Unit</strong> refers to an entity or establishment that is considered an individual
              economic unit engaged in economic activities.

              Both NACE and ISIC are classification systems used to categorize economic activities and units for
              statistical and analytical purposes.
              They provide a framework to classify different economic activities and units based on their primary
              activities.
